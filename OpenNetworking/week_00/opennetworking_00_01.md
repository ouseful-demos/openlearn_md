# Introduction and guidance


This free badged course, *Discovering computer networks: hands on in the Open Networking Lab*, lasts 24 hours, with 16 sessions, two sessions to a week. You can work through the course at your own pace, so if you have more time one week there is no problem with pushing on to complete a further study session. The eight weeks are linked to ensure a logical flow through the course. They are:

* Week 1 – Getting started: home networks and IP addressesWeek 1 – Getting started: home networks and IP addresses

* Week 2 – Moving data: an introduction to switching and routingWeek 2 – Moving data: an introduction to switching and routing

* Week 3 – Setting things up: configurationWeek 3 – Setting things up: configuration

* Week 4 – Traffic control: destination addresses, route tracing and collision avoidanceWeek 4 – Traffic control: destination addresses, route tracing and collision avoidance

* Week 5 – Making it happen: connecting devices and command-line controlWeek 5 – Making it happen: connecting devices and command-line control

* Week 6 – Understanding the network: underlying principlesWeek 6 – Understanding the network: underlying principles

* Week 7 – How it works: more of the principles that underlie networksWeek 7 – How it works: more of the principles that underlie networks

* Week 8 – Final practical considerations: security and complex networks.Week 8 – Final practical considerations: security and complex networks.

Most of your learning will be using videos and ‘screencasts’, which demonstrate practical skills using simulated computer networks. You will also have plenty of opportunities to try out the techniques for yourself. The course provides easy-to-use network simulation software integrated with practical online learning activities.

You can confirm your learning through interactive quizzes. The quizzes in Weeks 4 and 8 will provide you with an opportunity to earn a badge to demonstrate your new skills. You can read more on how to study the course and about badges in the next sections.

Once you have completed the course you will be able to set up, configure and troubleshoot simulated computer networks. You will understand the differences between the small-scale networks typically used in homes and the larger-scale networks used in commercial organisations. You will know how these different networks are managed, and you will have experience of practical activities using simulated versions of each.

### Moving around the course

In the ‘Summary’ at the end of each week, you will find a link to the next week. If at any time you want to return to the start of the course, click on ‘Full course description’. From here you can navigate to any part of the course.

It’s also good practice, if you access a link from within a course page (including links to the quizzes), to open it in a new window or tab. That way you can easily return to where you’ve come from without having to use the back button on your browser.

The Open University would really appreciate a few minutes of your time to tell us about yourself and your expectations for the course before you begin, in our optional [start-of-course survey ](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/discovering_computer_networks_start). Participation will be completely confidential and we will not pass on your details to others


## What is a badged course?


While studying *Discovering computer networks * you have the option to work towards gaining a digital badge.

Badged courses are a key part of The Open University’s mission *to promote the educational wellbeing of the community*. The courses also provide another way of helping you to progress from informal to formal learning.

Completing a course will require about 24 hours of study time. However, you can study the course at any time and at a pace to suit you.

Badged courses are available on The Open University’s [OpenLearn](http://www.open.edu/openlearn/about-openlearn/try) website and do not cost anything to study. They differ from Open University courses because you do not receive support from a tutor, but you do get useful feedback from the interactive quizzes.

### What is a badge?

Digital badges are a new way of demonstrating online that you have gained a skill. Colleges and universities are working with employers and other organisations to develop open badges that help learners gain recognition for their skills, and support employers to identify the right candidate for a job.

Badges demonstrate your work and achievement on the course. You can share your achievement with friends, family and employers, and on social media. Badges are a great motivation, helping you to reach the end of the course. Gaining a badge often boosts confidence in the skills and abilities that underpin successful study. So, completing this course could encourage you to think about taking other courses.

## How to get a badge


Getting a badge is straightforward! Here’s what you have to do:

* read each week of the courseread each week of the course

* score 50% or more in the two badge quizzes in Week 4 and Week 8.score 50% or more in the two badge quizzes in Week 4 and Week 8.

For all the quizzes, you can have three attempts at most of the questions (for true or false type questions you usually only get one attempt). If you get the answer right first time you will get more marks than for a correct answer the second or third time. Therefore, please be aware that for the two badge quizzes it is possible to get all the questions right but not score 50% and be eligible for the badge on that attempt. If one of your answers is incorrect you will often receive helpful feedback and suggestions about how to work out the correct answer.

For the badge quizzes, if you’re not successful in getting 50% the first time, after 24 hours you can attempt the whole quiz, and come back as many times as you like.

We hope that as many people as possible will gain an Open University badge – so you should see getting a badge as an opportunity to reflect on what you have learned rather than as a test.

If you need more guidance on getting a badge and what you can do with it, take a look at the [OpenLearn FAQs](http://www.open.edu/openlearn/about-openlearn/frequently-asked-questions-on-openlearn). When you gain your badge you will receive an email to notify you and you will be able to view and manage all your badges in [My OpenLearn](http://www.open.edu/openlearn/my-openlearn) within 24 hours of completing the criteria to gain a badge.
