# Session 1: The home network



![](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/ocw/pluginfile.php/1625457/mod_oucontent/oucontent/92007/01_abstract_network_system.tif)

When you use your home computer to access the internet or to interact with other computing devices within your home, you are doing this over your home network. A typical home network will include one or more computers, a printer, tablets, smartphones and a device which we’ll call a home gateway. In this session you will take a closer look at a typical home network.

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

* identify your home network as a local area network – defined as a group of computers and devices connected together in a small geographical areaidentify your home network as a local area network – defined as a group of computers and devices connected together in a small geographical area

* understand how the devices are connected togetherunderstand how the devices are connected together

* begin to think constructively about how these devices communicate with each other.begin to think constructively about how these devices communicate with each other.


## 1.1 Devices on a home network


In this part you will look at some of the devices in a typical home network. There are three short videos to watch and some activities. When you have completed this part you should be able to identify typical home network devices and the connections between them. In particular you should be able to identify a home gateway and understand some of its functions and connections. 

Watch the video below, which is about 2 minutes long. It explains what we mean when we talk about a home network.


### Devices on a home network

         ##-- MEDIACONTENT
        
Hello.

I’ve just been sending a few emails. One to my friend in Portugal, one to my sister who lives about four miles away, and one to husband – he’s working upstairs in the study, today it’s my turn for the kitchen table – but we just needed to exchange a few diary dates. I’ve also paid a few bills online, I’ve booked an airline ticket and I’ve been looking up some information on the internet.

You know, I’ve been using this technology for years now, but I’m still in awe of the way it all works, and I wonder whether you are too? The way our emails get to the right destination, the way we can access information from almost anywhere and the way all our devices will talk to each other. Somehow we take it all for granted, don’t we?

In this house, we’ve got what I think is probably a typical home network setup. There’s a device that I’m going to call the home gateway now that’s connect by cable into our telephone socket. It’s this device that gives us access to the internet, so ‘gateway’ is a good name for it. But quite often it’s also referred to as a home router. My husband and I have both got laptops. We can connect them directly into the home router, but more often than not we connect them wirelessly. We’ve got a wireless printer. We’ve both got smartphones; we’ve both got tablets. And all these devices can talk to each other from more or less anywhere within the house, though we do have a few dead spots.

This collection of interconnected computing devices in a fairly small geographical area is known as a local area network, usually abbreviated as LAN. 

In this session we’re going to take a closer look at that device that is at the heart of the home LAN: the home gateway, or home router as it’s sometimes called.

### Activity 1 Think about


#### Question

*5 minutes*

* 
List all the devices that are connected to your home network.


* 
Identify whether they use a wired or a wireless connection – or both.



#### Discussion

Did you remember to include devices like a games console, Kindle and smart TV?



Watch the video below, which is about 4 minutes long. This video looks at the network connections in a laptop and a home gateway.


### A closer look at network connections

         ##-- MEDIACONTENT
        
In this video I’m going to take a closer look at my own laptop and gateway – particularly those parts that are associated with the connections between the two.

I’ll start with my laptop. I’ve turned it round so you can see the connections at the back. I’ve got quite a few things plugged in here. Computers and most laptops provide what is known as an Ethernet port. This is for a direct wired connection between the computer and the home gateway. You can see my Ethernet port here. Ethernet is the computer networking technology most used in local area networks. As well as providing the physical system for connecting together a number of devices to form a local area network, Ethernet also controls the way information is passed between devices.

OK. Let’s have a look at this device that I’m calling my home gateway. You’ll often hear it called a router as well but actually it does so much more than routing, which is why I’ve chosen to call it a home gateway. Home gateways come in a variety of form factors. This is a picture of mine. It’s pretty old now – probably four or five years – but a similar model is still available to buy. Nevertheless all models will have some common features. I’ll run through some on mine.

Some models have internal antennas, but mine has two external ones, one set to the 5 GHz band and the other to the 2.4 GHz band. Mine has a set of status lights that indicate its current operating state. A steady light on this one indicates it has an internet connection. This one indicates that it has a functioning ADSL connection. ADSL stands for asymmetric digital subscriber line. It’s a type of broadband communications technology used for connecting to the internet through the copper cables of the telephone network. This is the power indicator. And this one shows whether or not there is a wired Ethernet connection. You’ll see it’s unlit on mine at present as I’m not using any Ethernet connection. This one, however, is lit. It shows there’s a wireless connection.

This set of lights here indicate the volume of activity over the connection. There’s not much activity on my computer at the moment, otherwise you might have seen these lights going up to the full range.

Now I’ll show you the back of my home gateway. I’ve removed all the connecting wires because it just makes it easier to see. So I’m not connected to anything at the moment but if I was this is where the power supply would be connected.

There’s a little dimple here with the word ‘reset’ next to it. If I needed to reset the router to its default settings I’d just have to stick the point of a pen or something like that into that little dimple.

These four connections here are known as Ethernet ports, sometimes called RJ45 ports. These are where I can plug in connections with my external devices such as a desktop computer.

Here at the bottom is the ADSL connection. I talked about ADSL a few moments ago. So this connects to my telephone socket.

Finally, if I look on the base of the device, there’s a label that gives me some more information about it. Do you see that mine identifies itself as a ‘wireless modem router’? Earlier on I said that the device had multi functions and there are some clues here about what these functions are.

The ‘wireless’ part tells you that it’s acting as a wireless access point, the ‘router’ part tells you that it has a routing capability and the ‘modem’ part indicates that it also incorporates a modem (which is short for modulator/demodulator). This converts the signals that arrive through the phone network into signals that can be understood by a computer.

As well as the make and model number of the device there is a set of four bar codes with letters and numbers below them all of which provide information for setting up and connecting to other devices. You’ll learn more about these later but for now, just be aware that most home gateways have some sort of label like this.

         ##-- ITQ
        

#### Question

If you can, have a look at your own home gateway. Try to identify some of the common features that were discussed in the video. Go online and search for images of home gateways. (Hint: use ‘home router’ as your search term.) Again, try to identify some of the common features that were discussed in the video.

The home gateway images I found online showed many different form factors. Most of them had external antennae – some as many as four. I found a number of images showing the Ethernet and ADSL ports at the back.

         ##-- ENDITQ
    
         ##-- ITQ
        

#### Question

Go online and search for images of home gateway labels. (Hint: use ‘home router label’ as your search term.) What are the most common features that you saw?

Most of the home gateway label images I found showed a set of bar codes, one or more of which had the word MAC by one of them; about half of them showed the SSID.

         ##-- ENDITQ
    
         ##-- ENDEXAMPLE
    
Watch the video below, which is about 1 minute long. It shows how drawing a diagram of a network helps to visualise how the different network devices are connected together.


### Network diagram

         ##-- MEDIACONTENT
        
So I’ve shown you some of the components of my own home network and in particular my home gateway. As well as my laptop, the other components I identified as being part of the network are my smartphone and my tablet. I also have a wireless printer. So to finish this session I’m going to create a quick sketch to show how all the components are connected together.

I’ll start with my home gateway. This is connected via the ADSL socket to my telephone socket. My home gateway also acts as a wireless access point and I’m indicating the wireless signals by these curved lines. This is quite a common method of indicating a wireless communication but you’ll come across other ways too.

Here are the other devices I identified: my phone, my tablet and the wireless printer, all with wireless connections to the network. There’s my laptop – again with a wireless connection – and my desktop computer with its wired Ethernet connection to my home gateway.

Your own home network may be different to this. For example your printer may have a physical wired connection to your computer and you might have many more devices than me.

*5 minutes*

Draw a diagram of your own home network.


#### Discussion

Your network diagram probably showed more wireless connections than wired connections.




## 1.2 The home gateway and network settings


In this part you will take a closer look at the home gateway and in particular ways of finding more information about home network settings. This will help you to: 

* investigate your own home gateway and network settingsinvestigate your own home gateway and network settings

* understand the significance of some of the information you find.understand the significance of some of the information you find.

There are three short videos to watch and several activities. When you have completed this part, you should be able to find information on your own home gateway. You should know the role of IPv4 and MAC addresses and recognise their format.

Watch the video below, which is about 6 minutes long. This shows you how to find information about your network using the Microsoft Windows settings page.


### Using the Windows settings page

         ##-- MEDIACONTENT
        
As you can imagine, your home gateway is a complex piece of equipment. Just think of all the tasks it has to do. Via the internet, it receives data from outside the LAN and directs it to a destination within the LAN, and it receives data from within the LAN and sends it out onto the internet.

In this and the next two videos I’m going to introduce you to three different ways of finding information about your home gateway and network settings. I’ll do this by investigating my own network. However, I’ll only be discussing some and not all of the information we’ll see there. Because I’m currently working on my laptop which is connected to my home network via Wi-Fi, much of the information will relate to my wireless network. If my laptop was connected to my home gateway by cable instead we’d be seeing something slightly different.

OK. In this video I’ll look at finding information through the Windows Settings menu. You can reach the Settings page from the Windows Start menu. Click on the settings icon to take you to Windows Settings. From here, click on the Network and Internet icon … then Wi-Fi followed by Hardware properties.

This is the Wi-Fi settings page. I’ll just run through some of the information you’ll find here.

SSID stands for service set identifier. It’s the name associated with a wireless LAN (abbreviated as WLAN) and is used for identification by devices wanting to connect to it.

The next four items give more information about my wireless network.

This one here – ‘Protocol’ – identifies the wireless protocol operating on the wireless LAN. A protocol is a just a set of rules for doing something. Wi-Fi is governed by a set of international standards so that it’s the same everywhere (more or less). These standards are administered by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (abbreviated as IEEE) but known as I triple E and they all have the number 802.11. These standards get updated from time to time so a letter, or letters, are added to indicate the version of the standard. Here you can see that the one used on my wireless network is 802.11n.

Moving down to the next item: the security used on my wireless network is shown as ‘WPA2-Personal’. WPA stands for Wi-Fi Protected Access. It’s a protocol that’s been used since 2004 for the protection of wireless networks. WPA2-Personal is a version designed for home users and small businesses. 

The next item – ‘Network band’ – gives information on the frequency band my network is using. It’s the 2.4 GHz band.

Moving down, the next item shows the channel used on the frequency band. This is something that’s automatically selected by the home gateway and it’s likely to change next time I connect. At the moment channel 1 is being used. Having a choice of transmission channels makes it possible to avoid contention with other nearby devices.

Two IPv4 addresses follow this so I’ll start by briefly explaining what an IPv4 address is, though you will be meeting IPv4 addresses again later in the course.

Every device participating in a computer network has an IP address assigned to it, and each IP address on a local network must be unique.

An IPv4 address is just a numeric identifier chosen from a pool of almost four thousand three hundred million possible addresses. By the way, IP stands for Internet Protocol which is the protocol used for sending data from one computer to another on the internet. For convenience, IPv4 addresses are written as four groups of decimal numbers from 0 to 255 separated by dots. You’ll often hear this referred to as ‘dotted decimal’ or ‘dotted denary’. In order to receive internet traffic, every device needs to have an IP address. Here you can see that the IPv4 address given for the wireless network adapter on my laptop is 192.168.2.5.

The second address shown here is labelled as ‘IPv4 DNS servers’ but in other contexts you might see this address labelled as ‘default gateway’. This is, in fact, the address of my home gateway and when my laptop wants to send data to my home gateway, this is the address it needs to use. It’s 192.168.2.1. I’ve already mentioned that a home gateway has multiple functions – one of which is to act as a DNS server to locate websites when you’re browsing the internet. DNS stands for Domain Name System. You’ll be learning more about DNS servers later, so I won’t say more about them here.

There’s also another address shown: the ‘Physical address (MAC)’. MAC stands for media access control. Like the IPv4 address, a MAC address (sometimes called the physical address or hardware address) is an identifier. Every computer network adaptor has one and each is unique. You can see that the MAC address is in a different format to the IPv4 address. This isn’t in dotted decimal and it includes letters as well as numbers, using a numbering system called hexadecimal. You’ll be learning about MAC addresses later in the course.

You may be wondering why my home gateway has both an IPv4 and a MAC address. Briefly, this is because these addresses are used in different ways at different times, and this is all you need to know for now.

So we’ve looked at the first method of finding information about your home gateway and network settings.

### Activity 4 Try it out


#### Question

*5 minutes*

Using the Windows settings page, find out and note the following:

* 
the IP address of your home gateway


* 
the IP address of your computer’s network card


* 
the MAC address of your computer’s network card.



#### Discussion

Have you spotted that the first three parts of the IP address of your home gateway and the computer’s network card are identical? Further on in the course you’ll be finding out why.



Watch the video below, which is about 4 minutes long. It shows you how to find similar network information using the command prompt.


### Using the command prompt

         ##-- MEDIACONTENT
        
In this video I’m going to show you a second method for getting information about a network. This method uses the command prompt. (The command prompt just provides another way for you to interact with your operating system.) The quickest way to open the command prompt is to enter `cmd` into the Windows search bar and then click on the ‘Command Prompt desktop app’ option.

This opens the command-line interface which enables the user to interact with the computer by typing in commands. The ipconfig command will display all current network configuration values. So I’ll type in `ipconfig`` followed by the Enter key.`

You’ll see some information you should recognise from the previous video: the addresses `192.168.2.5 and 192.168.2.1 (`here the address labelled ‘Default Gateway’ was called ‘IPv4 DNS servers’ in the previous video). But there’s something new: the ‘Subnet Mask’. Briefly, this stipulates that all allowed IP addresses on this network must have the form 192.168.2.X, where X is a number between 0 and 255.

Notice that the subnet mask consists of four dotted decimal numbers, just like the IP address. Where there’s a 255 in the mask, it means that the corresponding dotted decimal number in the IP address cannot be varied on this network. Doing so would produce a disallowed IP address for this network (though it may be OK on another one). So this subnet mask, 255.255.255.0, says that the viable addresses have three fixed numbers followed by a variable number.

Don’t worry if you feel a bit baffled by the idea of a subnet mask. You’ll be meeting it again later in the course where you should find this early but brief introduction was helpful.

Earlier on I said that when my laptop wants to send data to my home gateway, it needs to use the gateway’s IP address. Through the command-line interface there’s a very useful command that allows us to check whether the communication link between the two end points is working properly. The command is `ping` followed by the IP address at the end of the link we want to check. I’ll demonstrate this now to check the link between my laptop and my home gateway.

So I type in `ping`followed by my home gateway’s IP address 192.168.2.1.

You can see here that the ping command sends four packets of data to the IP address. In this context a packet is a data unit, though you will see it referred to by a different name in other contexts. When each packet is received a reply is sent back and at the end of the exchange some statistics are given. There is confirmation that four packets were sent, four received and none lost, and there’s a round-trip time given. The round trip is the time taken for the packet to be sent and the reply received. So in this example the ‘there and back’ journey between my laptop and my home gateway takes an average of one millisecond. One milliseconds is one thousandth of a second, so that’s pretty quick.

Next I’ll try pinging my tablet, which I know currently has an IP address of 192.168.2.3.

It’s no surprise that the round trip ping for this address took longer: 120 milliseconds on average. This is a more complex journey as the packet has to go through my home gateway to reach my tablet.

So now we’ve looked at the second method of finding information about your home gateway and network settings.

### Activity 5 Try it out


#### Question

*5 minutes*

* 
If you have more than one networked device (for example, a smartphone, a tablet, a second PC or laptop), check the allocated IP address of each device. (For smartphones and tablets you should find this in the settings pages.)


* 
Using the command-line prompt, ping another device on your home network (for example, your home gateway, smartphone or tablet) from your home computer. Make a note of the average round-trip time.



#### Discussion

If your ping was unsuccessful, check that you haven’t made a mistake when entering the IP address.



Watch the video below, which is about 5 minutes long. It shows you a third method for finding network information – using a browser.


### Using the web resource

         ##-- MEDIACONTENT
        
Now I’m going to show you the third method of finding information about your network. This method uses a web page. Do you remember that default gateway address we identified in the previous two activities? It was 192.168.2.1. Well, I’m going to enter it into my browser’s address bar. It may come as a surprise to you that you can enter an IP address into the address bar to access a web page instead of entering a URL. But a URL is just another form of IP address. So I press Enter and this takes me to a page for my modem-router setup. 

If I wanted to alter any of the modem-router settings, I’d need to log in. However, I’m just checking information here. There’s a lot of information on this page and I don’t intend to discuss all of it, but just to focus in on some. Look in the LAN and WLAN settings sections. Do you recognise any of the information shown there?

You should recognise my wireless LAN SSID: Belkin_N+_D60294. Remember you saw that in the information revealed through the Wi-Fi settings page on my laptop. You should be able to recognise the address of my home gateway (here labelled as ‘IP Address’): 192.168.2.1 and also the subnet mask beneath it: 255.255.255.0. Both of these were revealed in earlier activities. In fact, my home gateway has two IP addresses: one (known as the private address) faces towards my local area network and one (known as the public address) faces towards the internet. The IP address 192.168.2.1 that was revealed in earlier activities is the private address.

To identify the public address of my home gateway, we need to look in the ‘Internet Settings’ section. Its labelled ‘WAN IP’ (remember that WAN stands for wide area network), and here it’s shown as 2.25.177.217. The ‘Default Gateway’ address, here shown as 213.1.113.60, is the address for my internet service provider (ISP).

Just for interest, I’ll try to ping both of these addresses. So I’ll go back to the command prompt that I left open from the last session and I’ll type in `ping 2.25.177.217`. Remember this is the public address of my home gateway. Again you’ll see that four packets of data were sent and the statistics given are: four sent, four received, none lost. Approximate round trip time in milliseconds this time: average 1 millisecond. So it’s the same. It’s the same time it took to ping the internal address – my private address. Not surprising really since they’re both in the same location. You’d expect them to take about the same time. So now I’ll ping my ISP’s gateway: `ping 213.1.113.60` and Enter. So there’s another successful ping here. Four packets sent, four received, none lost. But this time the round trip in milliseconds is 13 milliseconds. So it’s taken a little bit longer for this packet to reach my ISP’s gateway and for a reply to be sent back. Not surprising: it has further to travel.

Public IP addresses can change frequently, so the next time I log on to my network I’m likely to see a different address. IP addresses that can change are known as dynamic addresses. You’ll learn more about these in later sessions.

So now you’ve seen the third way to find out more information about your home gateway and network settings.

What do they tell you about the connections between the two devices?

It takes longer for data to make the round-trip journey to a device outside your own home network than it does to make the journey to a device inside your own home network.




## 1.3 Packet Tracer Anywhere


As part of your work in this course, you will be building networks in a simulator called Packet Tracer Anywhere. This part introduces you to the simulator.

There are two short videos to watch followed by an activity. When you’ve completed this part you should be able to use the `ipconfig` and `ping` commands in Packet Tracer Anywhere.

Watch the video below, which is about 2 minutes long. It introduces you to Packet Tracer Anywhere.


### Introduction to Packet Tracer Anywhere – What is it?

         ##-- MEDIACONTENT
        
In this course we use two network simulators.

This one uses Cisco’s Packet Tracer software, which you might be familiar with. Cisco make a lot of network hardware, and a small amount of domestic network hardware. But they’re also involved in network education and training, which is why they’ve produced the Packet Tracer simulation software.

We’ve also got this much simpler network simulator, which is based on Packet Tracer but has a much simpler interface. It can be viewed on a browser. This simulator is called Packet Tracer Anywhere, or PT Anywhere for short. I’m going to give you a quick introduction to Packet Tracer Anywhere.

As Packet Tracer Anywhere is viewed in a browser, you get to it by clicking on a link. We’ve provided a few links on this site. Depending which link you click, you might get a preloaded network or a blank screen to construct a network in. Here I’ve got a preloaded network.

The switch is a device we haven’t met yet, although we’ll look at it in more detail in later sessions. The name ‘switch’ probably gives the impression it’s something like a light switch. Actually, it’s very different from an electrical switch. The name comes from the American word for a set of railway points. In the USA, points are called ‘switches’. A set of points, or a switch, is used to divert a train from one track to another, depending on the destination. You can think of the router and switch here as forming a unit that’s a bit like the home gateway. In fact, the Ethernet sockets on the back of a home gateway are the switch part of the device. The router and the switch here are actually based on large-scale commercial devices, and they’re more complicated than domestic devices. Packet Tracer Anywhere hides some of this complication, but not all of it. But we’re not going to go into that yet. That’s for much later in the course. The PCs in Packet Tracer Anywhere, though, are standard PCs. so I’ll concentrate on them in this part.


![](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/ocw/pluginfile.php/1625457/mod_oucontent/oucontent/92007/07_intro_to_packet_tracer_what_is_it.jpg)

         ##-- ENDMEDIACONTENT
    


Having seen how Packet Tracer Anywhere looks in a browser now watch the video below, which is about 4.5 minutes long. It shows you the basics of using Packet Tracer Anywhere.


### Introduction to Packet Tracer Anywhere – How to use it

         ##-- MEDIACONTENT
        
Now here’s a basic network. None of these devices has an IP number attached, so I’ll give them some IP numbers. I’ll start with this computer, RightHandSide. We select it, then go to ‘Edit device’, and choose ‘Interfaces’. I’m going to give it an interface address of 192.168.1.100. And for the subnet mask, the usual one for a home network: 255.255.255.0. And now the last bit, which is vital but easily missed because it’s off the bottom: ‘Submit’. So that’s sorted out that device.

Now I’ll set this one up: LeftHandSide. I’ll select it, then do ‘Edit device’, ‘Interfaces’. I’m giving this one an address of 192.168.1.105, and the usual subnet mask: 255.255.255.0. Again, the vital stage is easily missed because it’s off the bottom: ‘Submit’.

OK. Those computers now have IP addresses. So I’ll check them by pinging.

An easy way to get to the command prompt is just by double-clicking on the device, like that. And there’s the command line. I’ll do ping 192.168.1.100, which was the IP address of the other computer. Let’s see what happens. Good! That shows there’s a connection there between those two computers.

Now, I can add another device to this network, and I’m going to add another PC. I just drag this one up here like that. Then, with that selected, I do ‘Connect devices’, and drag this down here to the switch. There’s a choice of interfaces here. This one, PC0 ‘FastEthernet’, is the PC. And then ‘MySwitch’ – that’s the switch, naturally.

The PC actually has only one interface; so that’s selected by default anyway. On the switch I’m going to take this one, Fast Ethernet 4, and ‘Submit’. And I’ll give this an IP address. So ‘Edit device’, ‘Interfaces’, ‘IP address’ 192.168.1, and 110 for the last number. 

For the subnet mask, the usual one: 255.255.255.0. And again – so easily missed – ‘Submit’. And there we are.

Now, I’m going to check that all those are all talking to each other. I’ll go back to the one I started with, RightHandSide, and its command prompt. Type `ping`. And I want to check that this PC can reach the others.

By now I’m probably forgetting what IP addresses I gave them, so I’ll ping this one: 192.168.1.255. That 255 at the end makes this IP number special. It’s for broadcasting the same message to all devices on the local network. We can see we’ve got replies from number 105, that was the LeftHandSide computer; and from number 110; that was the one I added.

So those are the basics of PT Anywhere, and you’re welcome to have a play with it; and there’s an activity following this part.

#### Question

Open [PT Anywhere](https://forge.kmi.open.ac.uk/onl2-pt1.2) in a new tab or window so you can read these instructions. One of the PCs on this PT Anywhere network is not working properly. From PC0, send a ping to its network broadcast address and use the reply to find out which of PC1 and PC2 is malfunctioning. (Hint: First you will need to discover PC0’s IP address to work out what the network broadcast address is. When you send a ping to the network’s broadcast address, the reply from the address ending with ‘.1’ is from the router.)

The malfunctioning PC is PC2 with an IP address of 192.167.2.150.

To reach this conclusion you need to discover PC0’s IP address by selecting it and then going to ‘Edit device’, then ‘Interfaces’. You should have found that its IP address is 192.168.2.50 and therefore the network broadcast address is 192.168.2.255. The next step was to double-click on PC0 to open the command prompt and enter `ping 192.168.2.255`. The reply shows that PC0 can only talk to the device with IP address 192.168.2.1 (which is the router, as indicated in the hint to the previous question) and to the PC with IP address 192.168.2.100. It’s easy to discover that 192.168.2.100 is PC1 by checking PC1’s ‘Interfaces’ settings. Therefore it is PC2 that is malfunctioning. This PC has an IP address of 192.167.2.150.

#### Question

Change the IP address of PC2 to 192.168.2.150 then resend the ping to the broadcast address from PC0. What is the result?

The ping returned replies from 192.168.2.1, 192.168.2.100 and 192.168.2.150.

#### Question

What can you deduce from this?

PC2’s original IP address of 192.167.2.150 was inappropriate for this network. (In Session 2 you will find out why this address was inappropriate.)

## 1.4 Moving data around


This part gives a brief introduction to the way data travels around a computer network. It will:

* give you an insight into the layered model of communications networksgive you an insight into the layered model of communications networks

* remind you what a protocol isremind you what a protocol is

* introduce you to the TCP/IP protocol suite.introduce you to the TCP/IP protocol suite.

There is one short video and some activities. When you have completed this part you will be able to use the analogy of transporting goods using shipping containers to explain the way data travels round a computer network. In particular you should be able to appreciate the use of a layered model to separate, describe, explain and implement the tasks and processes involved and appreciate the significance of a layered model in communication networks.

Watch the video below, which is about 6 minutes long. It uses the analogy of moving goods around to explain the ideas about moving data across networks.


### Moving data around

         ##-- MEDIACONTENT
        
Hello. In this final part of Session 1 we’re going to look at how data’s moved from source to destination. By the end of it you should have an insight into the layered model of communications networks and you’ll have met the term ‘protocol’ again and you’ll have been introduced to the TCP/IP protocol suite.

Civilisations have been moving goods around for centuries and often over very long distances – say, from one side of the world to the other. This usually involves a complex network of components and processes all working together to pass the goods to the required destination. It’s generally the case that individual parts of this network have no understanding of the roles of the other parts or of the tasks performed by them. Computer networking is no different in this respect.

It’s often useful to organise the separation of these roles and tasks in terms of layers with each layer being responsible for different aspects of the communication process. To help you appreciate the concept of different layers associated with moving stuff from one place to another, let’s think about the system for transporting goods sealed inside shipping containers.

The shipping containers are made in standard sizes so that a system that’s set up to deal with one standard size, can deal with any. Also they aren’t fussy about what goods are placed within them (providing that the necessary safety procedures are observed, of course) nor what quantity. So shipping containers provide a uniform and secure capsule for the transportation of goods. What’s more, this capsule isn’t concerned with how it will reach its destination: it doesn’t need to know that. Its role has been fulfilled simply by containing the goods.

Once the goods are sealed inside them, the shipping containers can be loaded onto a carrier – often in multiples if required – and then conveyed to their destination. The medium for conveyance could be water, rail or road, or indeed all three of these during the course of the journey. As long as the carrier is appropriate for the medium, the exact details of the carrier aren’t important. For example, if the medium’s water, it doesn’t matter what type or size of cargo ship is used. The water doesn’t need to ‘know’ what type of vessel is moving through it. Likewise with road, the type, size and capacity of the vehicle transporting the goods isn’t of relevance.

So the system of conveying goods in shipping containers can be thought of as having layers, with each layer being responsible for a particular aspect of the journey. This provides us with a conceptual model to help us organise, explain and design the services needed.

At the bottom of the stack, which we’ll call layer 1, there’s the physical medium for conveyance: water, rail or road in our example. Above that, layer 2, there is the means to access the physical medium: the ship, train or lorry in our example. Then at the top, layer 3, there are the containers in which the goods travel. Each of these three layers is responsible for a different service and each layer has its own set of rules and procedures.

Computer networks also use a layered approach to the delivery of data from source to destination. At the bottom layer there’s the physical layer, the medium – for example cable, radio waves or light pulses – and at the top layer are the applications that provide the interface between the network and the end user. When you use your browser you’re using one of these applications. Between the top and bottom layer, different layers provide different and distinct services.

Like the shipping analogy, the layers in computer networks have their own set of rules and procedures. These are known as protocols and the collection of protocols from each layer is often called a protocol suite, a protocol family or a protocol stack.

The TCP/IP protocol suite is the name given to the suite of protocols used on the internet and most other computer networks. It derives its name from two of the most important protocols used in the suite: Transport Control Protocol, abbreviated as TCP, and Internet Protocol, abbreviated IP. It has a four-layer protocol stack with each layer taking responsibility for different tasks and using different protocols.

Layer 1 at the bottom is the Network Access layer. Above that at layer 2 is the Internet layer. Next at layer 3 is the Transport layer and at the top layer 41 is the Application layer.

In later sessions you’ll be learning about the role of each of these layers and the protocols that reside within them. This part has just provided you with a brief introduction.

This concludes Part 3 of Session 1. In this session you’ve met the term ‘protocol’ again, being a set of rules and procedures for doing something. You’ve been introduced to the way computer communication is modelled and designed in layers, and you know that the TCP/IP protocol suite is the name given to the suite of protocols used on the internet.

#### Question

What do you think is the benefit of splitting the tasks into a collection of different independent layers?

With each layer being independent of the others, a layer can be changed or amended without affecting the performance of the layers above or below it.

#### Question

Which layer in the TCP/IP protocol stack do you think is responsible for placing data on the physical medium?

Earlier on I said that the physical medium resides at the bottom layer, so in the TCP/IP protocol stack this is the Network Access layer.

## 1.5 Summary of Session 1


In this session you’ve looked closely at a home network which you should now be able to identify as a local area network (LAN). You’ve also had an introduction to some of the tasks performed by a home gateway and how tasks involved in communication networks are organised in hierarchical layers. You’ve learned how to find information on your own home gateway and other connected devices, including their IP address. You’ve used an IP address and the `ping` command to test connections between different devices, but there’s a lot more to IP addresses, as you’ll see in the next session.
